<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>350g of spaghetti</li>
    <li>200g of guanciale</li>
    <li>4 whole medium eggs</li>
    <li>100g of grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    <li>ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Boil the water for the pasta</li>
    <li>Cut the guanciale into small pieces, then simmer in a frying pan over medium heat for about 2 or 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>No need for oil: guanciale is already fat, greasy and fabulous of its own. If you want, you can add a tablespoon of cooking water and emulsify. When ready, turn off the heat, cover with a lid and set aside.</li>
    <li>Now whisk the Pecorino Romano (which is a very salty and tasty Italian cheese so there’s no need to add salt) with the eggs.</li>
    <li>Add a little bit of ground black pepper. Stir quickly with a fork – or a hand whisk until you get a creamy sauce.</li>
    <li>This sauce made of eggs and pecorino must be quite thick. Set aside. The water should now boil and you can cook the spaghetti. If you have chosen a rather large pot, the spaghetti should fit comfortably without breaking them. Whole spaghetti, not broken. So that you can roll them more easily around the fork tines, without the help of a spoon #eatlikeanitalian. The best way to cook spaghetti without breaking them is to hold them in a bunch vertically and immerse.</li>
    <li>Let go and they will fall out in all directions. As they soften, with the help of a fork let them sink, then stir. So cook the spaghetti al dente, following the cooking time found on the pasta packaging.</li>
    <li>With the help of a spaghetti spoon, drain when they are ready. Then put them in the frying pan, OVER HIGH HEAT, to season them properly with the fat of the guanciale.</li>
    <li> When the spaghetti and guanciale are sizzling in the pan, TURN OFF THE HEAT, otherwise the eggs cook too much and you’ll find yourself with scrambled eggs and spaghetti! Now quickly add the eggs and pecorino cream and stir. The frying pan is warm but not hot so that the eggs will cook without lump. Pay attention to the consistency, which must be creamy, but not fluid.</li>
    <li>Add guanciale (the one left in the pan), freshly grounded black pepper and grated pecorino Romano cheese to taste.</li>
    <li>Ready!</li>
</ol>
