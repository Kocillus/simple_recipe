<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>It’s nearly the universal comfort food, and there are SO many variations!  In fact, I almost didn’t post this recipe, as there are SOOOO many mac and cheese recipes available, and most people already have their favorite way of making it.</p>
<p> Of course, there’s no “right” way or “wrong” way, so I’m here sharing the way I like to make my mac and cheese (the way my family loves it too).</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>500g of elbow pasta</li>
    <li>100g of unsalted butter</li>
    <li>100g of all purpose flour</li>
    <li>300ml of milk</li>
    <li>500g of grated medium sharp cheddar cheese divided</li>
    <li>150g of grated Gruyere cheese divided</li>
    <li>1/2 tbsp. of salt</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp. of black pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp. of paprika</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Boil the pasta</li>
    <li>Drain the pasta</li>
    <li>Make the cheese sauce by combining a fat (butter), and starch (flour), then whisking in the milk products.</li>
    <li>Cook the sauce until it’s nice and thick.</li>
    <li>Add in shredded cheeses, stir well.</li>
    <li>Combine cheese sauce with cooked pasta.</li>
    <li>Transfer half of the mac and cheese to a baking dish, sprinkle with more shredded cheese.</li>
    <li>Top with the rest of the mac and cheese, top with more shredded cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake for 15 minutes, until cheesy is bubbly and lightly golden brown</li>
    <li>Ready!</li>
</ol>
